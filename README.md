# Dot Files for Bash and ZSH

These are some of my commonly used aliases. I like to maintain them in VCS so I can update them frequently. 

## Usage

You will only need to symlink the rc file for your shell. All the other files are dynamically sourced from the rc file.

```bash
cd ~
ln -s ${Path to this repo}/.zshrc .
```
